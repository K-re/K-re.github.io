# Hell0 World!
This is my First Blog Post using the Jekyll and Github Platforms.
This is also the first time I've ever reall used the Markdown Langauge.

Watch this space for more Posts. Especially, Geob 479 related materials.

I hope to implement a tag system which can be used to categorise the entries.

Your patience in this regard is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
